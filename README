May or may not have anything to do with Meg Griffin :)

A simple text editor in C that reads the content of a file and dumps it to stdout. Added functionality now enables you to create and edit files.
I intend to build on this primitive text editor to add more features, such as editing capabilities, saving changes, handling different file formats, and more.

This program is designed to work in linux systems as ncurses is not available on Windows.
    Should you want to run on Windows:
        1. ncurses is not natively available on Windows, so you might need to replace it with a pdcurses or remove its dependency if cross-compilation becomes complex.
        2. Ensure that any required DLLs (like pdcurses.dll) are included with your exe file.
    
    I do not intend to make it cross-platform at present.
